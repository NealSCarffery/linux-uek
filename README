UEK: Oracle's Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel
===================================

The Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel (UEK) is a Linux kernel built by Oracle and 
supported via Oracle Linux support. Its focus is performance, stability, and 
minimal backports by tracking the mainline source code as closely as is 
practical. UEK is well-tested and used to run Oracleâ€™s Engineered Systems, 
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, and large enterprise deployments for 
Oracle customers.

In UEK Release 5, areas of focus include adding support for 
Persistent Memory (PMEM) and Direct Access (DAX), 
RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE), KVM, and ARM architecture as well as 
improvements in NUMA balancing, DTrace and filesystems XFS and Btrfs.
